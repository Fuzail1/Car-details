        <p>The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by the Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. The car was introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show and was completely sold out before the show ended. Succeeding the Agera, the Jesko is named as a tribute to the company founder's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg. There are two variations of the car, the "Absolut" and the"Attack".The engine is a development of the 5.1 L (5,065 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the Agera. It has four valves per cylinder each with a bore and stroke of 92 mm × 95.25 mm (3.62 by 3.75 inches) and a compression ratio of 8.6:1.The engine is mated to an in-house developed 9-speed multi-clutch transmission called the "Light Speed Transmission (LST)"[1] by the manufacturer.</p>

By March 2016, Lamborghini had built 5,000 Aventadors. At the time, it was the second best selling Lamborghini model ever. It was replaced by the new Aventador S in 2016.The Aventador LP 700–4 used Lamborghini's 700 PS (515 kW; 690 hp) 6,498 cc (6.5 L; 396.5 cu in) 60° V12 engine, weighing about 235 kg (518 lb).
